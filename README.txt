Summary:
This project is a web application using the Flask framework. The application
displays items by category and sub category. There is a JSON end point that 
allows downloading the catalog in a JSON format. Users can register with their
Google Plus account to have the ability to add, edits, and delete items.

Usage:
The database_setup.py file can be used to create a blank database and the 
additems.py can be used to add sample items to the database.
